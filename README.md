# Super Racer
As one of my personal favorte Creative Assignments that I have worked on during my year in the CMU CS Academy course, I decided to add this special project as a fully-fledged repo right here on Github.

While I have imported the base code alongside the <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop">official CMU Graphics Library,</a> I have been considering evolving on this program, and making it into a more refined game.
For now, this will serve as a personal archive of one of my favorite works.

## Installation
You can install all of the files as once, or clone the repository. Regardless of how the files are installed,
the cmu_graphics folder needs to remain beside the python file in the same directory as the python file.

If the cmu_graphics folder was lost by any chance, or cmu makes some form of update to the desktop library, <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop">you can install it here.</a>
