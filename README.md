As one of my personal favorte Creative Assignments that I have worked on during my year in the CMU CS Academy course, I decided to add this special project as a fully-fledged repo right here on Github.

While I have imported the base code alongside the <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop">official CMU Graphics Library,</a> I have been considering evolving on this program, and making it into a more refined program.
For now, this will serve as a personal archive of one of my favorite works.
